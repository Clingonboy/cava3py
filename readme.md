## cava3py

In this version here is the possibility to load spicific card distribution.

This permitt to test spicific simulation.

## JSON file that collect the result

```JSON
{
  "date": "2022/10/02 21:00:00",
  "Start_card_G1": [5, 6, 8, 1, ...],
  "Start_card_G2": [5, 6, 8, 1, ...],
  "Total_played_cards": 121,
  "Total_taking": 5,
}

```
